This is a binary classification problem. The tast is to identity whether it is a cat image or not. The problem is inspired from the MOOC on
Deep learning specialization on Coursera. I have implemented my own deep neural network library, it starts with basic optimization algorithms
and activation functions. Later more optimization algorithms and acivation functions will be added.

Second notebook contains how to prevent overfitting by using L2 regularization.
