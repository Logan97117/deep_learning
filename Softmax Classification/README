Softmax classification using feedforward neural networks implemented from scratch and using Tensorflow.
The problem is taken from Kaggle competition on Digit recognizer. The code achieved a public score of 0.96151 on kaggle.
Hyperparameter tunng is to be done on with this neural network architecture.
